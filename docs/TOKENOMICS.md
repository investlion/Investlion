# InvestLion (ILION) – Tokenomics

This document outlines the token structure, supply, and management principles of the InvestLion ecosystem.

ILION is designed as a utility token, not a speculative or investment product.

  - Utility expansion
  - Strategic ecosystem development

## Burning Mechanism

ILION supports token burning:
- Users may burn their own tokens voluntarily
- Burning reduces the total supply permanently
- No forced or hidden burn mechanisms exist

---

## Liquidity Status

ILION currently has very low public liquidity.

- The token is not positioned for active trading at this stage
- Displayed market prices may not reflect real value
- The project is focused on development and utility, not price speculation

Liquidity decisions will only be made when they align with platform readiness and ecosystem demand.

## Distribution Philosophy

ILION distribution prioritizes:
- Platform utility
- Fair participation
- Long-term sustainability

There are no guaranteed returns, fixed yields, or profit promises associated with holding ILION.

Users should understand:
- Token value may fluctuate significantly
- Liquidity may be limited or unavailable
- Participation is voluntary and at the user’s own risk

## Commitment to Transparency

InvestLion is committed to:
- Open-source documentation
